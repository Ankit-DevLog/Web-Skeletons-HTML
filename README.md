# 🌐 Web Skeletons: HTML Edition
This is where I document my progress in mastering web architecture. As a **BCA student** in Rewa, I believe that a strong foundation in HTML is the key to building high-end digital experiences.

### 🏗️ What's Inside:
* **Semantic HTML:** Using the right tags for SEO and accessibility.
* **Structure Practice:** Tables, Forms, and List-based layouts.
* **College Assignments:** Solutions to official HTML practicals from **APSU**.
* **Mini Projects:** My first "About Me" and "Portfolio" skeletons.

### 📸 Connect with the Journey:
I post visual updates and "Code-with-me" sessions on Instagram: **[@Ankit.DevLog](https://instagram.com/Ankit.DevLog)**.
